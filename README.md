# Research-on-the-Construction-of-Chinese-Multimodal-Metaphor-Corpus-and-Sentiment-Classification
We create a new Chinese multimodal metaphor corpus, which includes 8089 text image pair samples. 
We manually annotated at a fine-grained level whether the data is a metaphor, as well as the emotions of joy, anger, sadness, fear, shock, and neutrality triggered by metaphors. 
Unlike the previous emotional annotations of "positive, negative, and neutral" metaphors both domestically and internationally, this study attempts for the first time to provide fine-grained emotional annotations for multimodal metaphors.
